/**
 * @class ForkableRegistry
 * @brief A registry for managing fork-aware objects in a PHP extension.
 *
 * This class is NOT thread-safe. Registration of forkable objects should only be performed
 * during extension initialization or within the Zend Engine's main execution thread (the primary PHP thread).
 * Attempting to register forkables from other threads may lead to unpredictable behavior and race conditions.
 *
 * The deliberate absence of mutex protection is intentional: adding synchronization primitives could
 * introduce deadlock scenarios during process forking. Specifically, if another thread holds a mutex
 * lock during the pre-fork phase, the child process would inherit a locked mutex that can never be
 * unlocked (since the thread that locked it doesn't exist in the child process), resulting in a deadlock.
 *
 * @note Thread Safety: This class is not thread-safe by design. All operations must be performed
 *       from the main PHP thread.
 * @note Fork Safety: The class provides pre-fork and post-fork hooks to ensure proper state
 *       management across process boundaries.
